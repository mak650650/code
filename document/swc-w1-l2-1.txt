The two learning of this chapter are as following:-

1.Their is a quote in Bhagat Gita ,"kaarm karte jaoo fal ki iccha maat karoo",as per this quote we should 
  focused on process or one would say efficent process instead of focusing on outcome.

2.But here come a question that for ,whom we should do this process and why,working for ourselves is still 
  same as old situation instead we should work very less for ourselves,Hence we end up with the answer of 
  working for other parameters such as nation,family ,legacy etc.
